# Power Consumption Frequency Forecasting

This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting frequency trends in power consumption data using statistical time series methods. The goal is to predict short-term frequency fluctuations with high accuracy using the ARIMA model.
## Project Overview
- **Data Source**: Real-world power grid frequency data from https://www.cercind.gov.in/ (official public source).
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Sklearn
- **Model Used**: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

## Key Features

- Real-world data integration
- EDA with trend analysis, outlier detection
- ARIMA model tuned using ACF/PACF analysis.
- Forecast accuracy evaluated using MSE.
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual frequency trends
- Forecast trends aligned well with actual frequency data.
